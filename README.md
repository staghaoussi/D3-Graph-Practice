# D3-Graph-Practice
Used ObservableHq to practice the D3.js module.

ObservableHq is a website created for visualization purposes... D3 code can be written on the website.
I wrote this code during my BC-Gov coop to practice/familiarize myself with the d3.js library.

Published notebook can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/@staghaoussi/visualizing-data-of-british-columbias-class-sizes).
